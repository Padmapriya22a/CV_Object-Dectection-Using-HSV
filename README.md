# Object-Dectection-Using-HSV

**Hi Guys!!!**


This repository is about the object detection using HSV ie. Hue, Saturation, Value
where, Hue denotes the pure color (0 to 360 deg)
Saturation refers to the intensity of the color (0-100%) 
Value refers to the brightness of the color (0-100%)

The object_detection-using HSV1.ipynb file is a simple example of identifying the object using fixed HSV Scale where blue coloured object is identified.
The output is,

The Trackbar.ipynb file is the basic example of trackbar which can be used to easily identify the HSV Values later on.
The sample outputs are given in outputs_trackbar folder

The object_detection-HSV2 using trackbar.ipynb file demonstrates how the trackbar can be used to get a particular coloured object from the image.
The output is,

The object_detection-HSV3_video.ipynb file is the blue coloured object detection in a webcam. 
The output video is uploaded as video.mp4.

**Happy Coding!!!**
